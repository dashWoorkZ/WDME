# Web Design Made Easy VLOG I

### From Concept to Conception

#### \*Notes from the Author\*

CSS3 Reset

A list of selected elements preset with attributes conditional throughout the document, they are listed as "Preset CSS3"

Navigation

There are two(2) navigation elements in this design:

-   #### Hamburger Menu
    
    an animated navigation list, toggled by the USER taking an ACTION
    
-   #### Standard NAV
    
    a standard navigation element with horizontal display.
    

Images

All images required for the project have been included, all images are original in design."

The current WDME Logo was originally created with an HTML5 standard Element framework and CSS3, i will leave the option open, if anyone is interested in a video on that.

Javascript

To be honest, if i use someone elses code, i genrally leave a comment, giving them credit for the concept, i isually modify the code somehow like the javascript for this animation it one-directional, then i added bidirectionality to it, the javascript looks pretty poor, so i suspect it is mine, but it may have been influenced by something i saw by Kevin Pwell or Adam Koury or anyone else, if i have used the Javascript code without acknowledging the originator of it, i apologize.

CSS3

I will claim most of the CSS3 included has been created through diligent effort and not pagiarized cut-and-paste, although there may be one CLAS, the GRID-AUTO-FIT CLASS, which i do use in the document, did in fact come from Kevin Powell, outside of that and the functions if included, but it is credited, so the CSS3 file is divided between sections, the one i mentioned, "Preset CSS3", "Interactive Classes", "Grid and Flex Presets", "Content Based" and "@Media", the "Content Based" is designed for the settings that apply throughout the document, the "@Media" section contains the changes in the code required for the page to be "Responsive" and "Full Page".

HTML5

In order to reduce the number of CLASSes and ID identifiers, i chose to identify the elements with HTML5 Standard ElementsS where possible, i do use some classes where it was deemed a viable option.  
"**A very simple layout to start"

Grid

Grid is used

Flex

Flex is used, a note, i could use some constructive criticism on my styling attributes used on any FLEX ITEMS

Custom Variables

Currently the majority of the "Custom Variables" used are for COLOR, i have a few for PADDING and WIDTH, but not many at this stage of development, there are some ARIA references in the JAvascript, which is another reason i think Kevin Powel may have influencede it, I know Kevin did a video on ARIA at some point, this may have been my attempt to incorporate it into some of my code, but i think it originated with Kevin Powell, anyway, they are what they are, and they can be more, if you so choose.

Responsive Design

I actually came up with the design of the CSS3 page while editing all the crap out, it was the "Hamburger Menu" that started me culling all the crap repeat lines, i left a few, i am sure, i was looking for atleast four(4) - five(5) different elements before i ganged them together to share one attribite, so i culled for awhile and it is what i left it as, feel free to modify it to your hearts content, it does work well, easy to add more "@Media" sections or change the current, so maybe in future VLOGS we will.

So, if you would like, you can use my notes and the FIGMA type images to try and create the web page, or follow along with the video, i will go through each section mentioned, i just might not include all the inputing of the CSS3,

i hope you like this little project-in-the-making, and join me as i explore how and why i even decided to create this in the first place, and how i decided to turn it into what it has become
